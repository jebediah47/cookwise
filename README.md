# Cookwise
**Cookwise** is an AI-powered cooking assistant built with Next.js, schadcn/ui, Clerk and Google GenKit.

Originally developed as part of the [YES Summer School](https://yes.aueb.gr), hosted by the [Department of Management Science and Technology](https://www.dept.aueb.gr/dmst) at the [Athens University of Economics and Business](https://aueb.gr), Cookwise was the winning entrepreneurship idea from **YES Team 4**.

Special thanks to my incredible teammates and the organizing committee for making this project a reality!
